    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I have it on good authority that this is the real deep-dish pizza dough that's used in Chicago. The real thing is nothing like bread or even pizza dough. It's a buttery, flaky crust that's achieved by using corn oil (not butter) and minimal mixing and kneading times. The pizza itself is built with cheese, toppings, and sauce, in that order. Contrary to popular opinion, Chicago pizzerias do not use cornmeal in the dough.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Active dry yeast</li>
        <li>White sugar</li>
        <li>Warm water</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Corn oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; knead until dough holds together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. Turn to coat dough with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press dough into a 10-inch deep-dish pizza pan and follow your pizza recipe.</li>
        <li>Add cheese, toppings, and tomatoes that you've flavored with garlic, basil, oregano, etc. Bake the pizza in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, depending on your oven. You can prebake the crust for 10-15 minutes before adding toppings if desired.</li>
    </ol>
